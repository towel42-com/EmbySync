1.0 - Initial version
    Syncs User data, including favorite
        Requires two calls to sync due to a bug in Emby's API
    Does not sync "rating" system as thats not availble via the API
    Does not sync user setup meta data, which is not currently available
        Ie page layout settings
    A vs B comparison uses the last played date.
        Emby doesnt have a "last time the media was modified for a user API call
    Can not sync users (ie put user X from server A onto server B)
        No Emby API exists for this
